# FlexGlove-Real-Time-Robotic-Control-Interface
-Designed and engineered an innovative glove interface using Arduino microcontrollers and flex sensors to capture
precise hand movements, either wirelessly transmitting data to a Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth or wired up to DoBot.
-Configuration of Dobot Magician robotic arm to accurately replicate hand movements based on
received input, using C++ for wired and Python/C++ for wireless.

Materials:
- Flex Gloves
- Arduino Mega
- Lcd Screen
- Piezo
- Slide Switch
- Raspberry pi for Wireless
